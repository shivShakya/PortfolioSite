        <div class="content" >
            <p><b>Craft Store:</b> This project is something I've always wanted to work on...</p>
            <p><b>Problem:</b> In my childhood, I used to enjoy making papercraft, designing toys, and creating architectural models. I often wondered what if I could sell these creations and earn my own pocket money. This thought led me to the idea of creating an online platform where I could showcase and sell my crafts.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I noticed that there are many talented handicraft workers who lack a proper platform to showcase and sell their products. They often rely on local markets and struggle to reach a larger audience, limiting their growth potential. This is where my website, "Craft Store," comes into play.</p>
            <p>Craft Store aims to provide a platform for both established small businesses and individual crafters to sell their handcrafted products easily. By leveraging a recommendation system and implementing various filtering options, the website ensures that customers can discover a wide range of crafts based on their preferences. The platform not only benefits sellers by increasing their reach and potential customer base but also offers customers a convenient and diverse shopping experience.</p>
            <p><b>Technologies Used :</b> MERN stack (MongoDB database , Express , React framework , Node.js</p>

            <p><b>Aamchi Mess: A Mess Management System</b></p>
            <p>This project was assigned to our group as part of our software engineering course. We chose this topic because we were facing daily problems related to the mess while living in the college hostel.</p>
            <p>For this project, we developed an Android application and followed the principles and best practices of software engineering. Our process involved requirement analysis, design and architecture, development, testing, and deployment. Working on this project provided us with valuable learning experiences.</p>
            <p>I had the opportunity to lead the team and mentor its members as I had knowledge about most of the technologies involved. I provided necessary training to my team members on Android Studio, Flask framework for the backend, and also introduced them to MongoDB.</p>
            <p>This project enhanced my skills in team building and leadership, and gave me a better understanding of how work is carried out in professional settings. Overall, it was a rewarding experience.</p>

        <p><b>Robotic Simulation</b></p>
        <p><b>Problem:</b> Manufacturing companies require a simulation-based system to effectively manufacture their products. Simulation helps them envision and create high-quality products.</p>
        <p>This project was assigned by my teacher in the subject of computational geometry and computer graphics. As someone who has always had a keen interest in 3D graphics, I began working with Blender, a 3D software, from a young age. This experience proved invaluable when creating this project using three.js. Additionally, I used websites like <a href="https://sketchfab.com/feed">Sketchfab</a> to download 3D models for designing purposes.</p>
        <p>I am grateful for the experience I gained while working with three.js, WebGL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as they proved to be extremely useful during the development of this project. Furthermore, working on this project allowed me to enhance my skills in writing classes and methods to make the program more modular, which was an opportunity for personal growth.</p>

    <div class="content" >
        <p><b>Face Recognition Attendance:</b> A machine learning project</p>
        <p><b>Problem:</b>I often wondered why my university relied on biometric machines for attendance when it could be easily marked using online platforms.</p>
          <p>In this system, a machine learning model is trained with facial data to recognize individuals and mark their attendance accordingly. Inspired by the potential of machine learning and data science, I embarked on creating a biometric-like system. After dedicated efforts spanning two months, I successfully developed this attendance system.</p>
        <p> So when i was learning about machine learning and data science , i got an idea to create something like biometric system. And after the 2 months of efforts I developed this system.</p>
        <p>Throughout this project, I gained practical experience in machine learning and data science methodologies, including data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model deployment on the web. Leveraging my strong command of Python, I found the process incredibly interesting. Additionally, automating file creation and deletion was a significant aspect of this project, providing valuable insights and learning opportunities.</p>
        <p>Technologies used in this project include Python, React, Flask framework (Python), and Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy, as and when required.</p>

           <p> This is where I keep all my certificates from various fields. Over the years, I have earned certificates in diverse areas such as theatre, debate, academics, and coding competitions. </p>
           <p><b>Coding Competitions:</b> I had the opportunity to participate in a Hackathon Competition where I won the first prize. The competition focused on Signal Vibration Processing, specifically finding the time interval between two consecutive peaks in an audio signal. Although signal processing was new to me, I embraced the challenge and successfully solved the problem through my dedicated efforts.</p>
           <p><b>Theatre Competitions:</b> During my college years, I actively participated in my college theatre society called DHWANI. Being a part of the society for three years was an incredible and transformative experience. From initially being a shy and underconfident student, I evolved into someone who could confidently express myself on stage through street plays and stage performances. The journey was mesmerizing, and I cherish the personal growth it brought me. </p>
        
           <p><b>Debates : </b> During my school days, I enthusiastically participated in various debate and poetry competitions, both within my college and at external events. As a result, I earned several certificates that recognize my passion for public speaking and articulating my thoughts effectively.</p>
           <p><b> Academic :</b>  This section comprises all my academic certificates, highlighting my academic achievements from 10th grade to my master's degree.</p>
